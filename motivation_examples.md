    "question": "Melanie is a door-to-door saleswoman. She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, 2 more to the red house, and half of what was left at the orange house. If Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left, how many did she start with?",
    "reasoning": "Melanie sold 1/3 of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, so she had 2/3 left.\nShe then sold 2 more at the red house, so she had 2/3 - 2 = 4/3 left.\nShe then sold half of what was left at the orange house, so she had 1/2 * 4/3 = 2/3 left.\nSince she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, then 2/3 is equal to 5, and 1/3 is equal to 5/2 = 2.5.\nSo Melanie had 2.5 * 3 = 7.5 vacuum cleaners at the beginning.\nBut you can't have a fraction of a vacuum cleaner, so Melanie must have had 8 vacuum cleaners at the beginning.",

2/3 - 2 = 4/3 ???



Question: "The cost of one visit is $2. After 150% increase, the new cost is 2 + 2 * 1.5 = $<<2+2*1.5=6>>6.\nPauline visits the museum 3 times a year. In the first 5 years, she spent 5 * 3 * 2 = $<<5*3*2=30>>30.\nIn the next 3 years, she spent 3 * 6 = $<<3*6=18>>18.\nSo in total, she spent 30 + 18 = $<<30+18=48>>48."
